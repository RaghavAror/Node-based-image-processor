# Node-Based Image Processor

## Overview

The Node-Based Image Processor is a desktop application that allows users to load images, process them through a series of connected nodes, and save the resulting output. This interface functions similarly to node-based editors like Substance Designer, where operations are represented visually and can be connected in various configurations.

## Features

- Load and save images in various formats (JPG, PNG, BMP).
- Apply image processing operations such as brightness/contrast adjustment, Gaussian blur, and more.
- Real-time preview of image processing results.
- Intuitive node-based interface for connecting and configuring operations.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- OpenCV library
- Qt framework (for GUI)
- CMake (for building the project)

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-based-image-processor.git
   cd node-based-image-processor
